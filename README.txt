MultiList Project

Instruction to run the program:

You can run the program in VSCode, go to a command line and type "make clean" -> "make" -> "./main.exe" without the quotoes. 
However, you must have g++ and make installed. 

You can download the repo directly from github: https://github.com/Ramo-11/MultiListProject
And then you can run it on Tesla. Again by typing "make clean" -> "make" -> "./main.exe" without the quotoes

Or you can just copy the code from Node.h, Node.cpp, and main.cpp, from my github and run it however you want. 

Instructions to use the program:

The program is very easy to use (user friendly), and it will guide you and show you error message if an invalid input was entered.

Shall you encounter any issues, please contact me.
